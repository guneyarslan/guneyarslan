v00: Already knew HTML, CSS. I learned new HTML5 tags.
v01: I started to learn Java, C# and Python syntax.
v02: Already learned Python syntax because i understand English.
v03: Learning logics of some "Alghoritms".
v04: Learned Java and C# syntax in the same time i guess, because they are similar.
v05: I checked Java and C# knowledge, I still confuse the two. I think similarity is not that good.
v06: Looking some SQL and database logic. Tried some database queries with MSSQL in SQL and T-SQL.
v07: Started to create a website template with Bootstrap5.
v08: I finished my website template in 3-4 days. (With little help from Chat-GPT)
v09: I used a little javascript codes in my website so i am aware i need to learn javascript as well.
v10: I started to learn Javascript but it looks hard for me, well i already know Java and C#, because of that
i understand the logic behind the code, but writing it from zero is something different.
v11: I learned a lot of alghoritms but i still don't know how to use it in real life. I think i need to do more project.
v12: I'm really trying to do something in MS SQL, it's ok to do with UI but in codes it looks complicated.
These codes are even much more easier to understand than other languages but idk i think it's not my interest.
v13: I learned a lot of things about "OOP", i liked polymorphism and implements i can't wait to see some examples about them.
v14: OK, i checked some examples about OOP and i think i can wait a little more. It's still early lol.
