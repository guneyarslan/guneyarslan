This is an update log for every important thing I've done on this topic since I got into development. People are just like an app. SDLC rules also apply to people who want to improve themselves. 

v00: I already knew HTML and CSS long ago. I just learned about the new tags that come with HTML5.
v01: I started to learn Java, C# syntax.
v02: Since I know English, the Python syntax seemed very easy to me. So for now I won't look at it until I need it.
v03: Learning logics of some "Alghoritms".
v04: Learned Java and C# syntax in the same time i guess, because they are similar.
v05: I checked Java and C# knowledge, I still confuse the two. I think similarity is not that good.
v06: Looking some SQL and database logic. Tried some database queries with SQL and T-SQL in MsSQL.
v07: Started to create a website template with Bootstrap5.
v08: I finished my website template in 3-4 days. (With little help from Chat-GPT)
v09: I had to use Javascript code in the website I made. I got help from the ChatGPT about this because I don't know Javascript. But I am aware that I have to find out as soon as possible.
v10: I started taking a government-sponsored algorithm course online.
v11: I learned a lot of alghoritms but i still don't know how to use it in real life. I think i need to do more project.
v12: I made some experiments on the Northwind database dataset with MS Sql. Although the codes seem very easy, operating them really requires knowledge.
v13: I learned a lot of things about "OOP". I really loved the Polymorphism and Inheritance stuffs.
v14: I've done some research on "agile" software development and SCRUM in particular. I think it is a good way to satisfy the customer and to understand the work received correctly.
