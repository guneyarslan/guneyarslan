- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Hasret GÃ¼ney Arslan. I'm living in Istanbul/Turkey. I am a front-end web developer with a passion for creating dynamic and responsive websites. I began my journey as a web developer in October 2022 and have since honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also experienced in building responsive layouts that are optimized for mobile devices.In my work, I prioritize clean and well-organized code that is easy to maintain and update. I am also committed to staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in web development, and am constantly learning and expanding my skillset. I am a strong collaborator and enjoy working in a team environment, as well as independently. I am excited to continue my journey as a web developer and am eager to bring my skills and expertise to a new project or team.
